(** {6 Dispatchers} *)

(** The main dispatcher

    The dispatcher should be used with {!Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch} as:
    [Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch Ocamlbuild_js_of_ocaml.dispatcher]

    Side note: {!Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch} should be used only once as
    it record only one function for an ocamlbuild module.
*)
val dispatcher : Ocamlbuild_plugin.hook -> unit

(** Same as {!dispatcher} followed by {!oasis_support} *)
val dispatcher_with_oasis_support :
  executables:string list ->
  Ocamlbuild_plugin.hook ->
  unit


(** {6 Low level functions} *)

(** Map each targets given as argument to ocamlbuild and replace each element
    that exists in [~executables] by its corresponding .js target.

val oasis_support : executables:string list -> unit
