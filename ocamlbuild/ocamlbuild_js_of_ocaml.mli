(** Ocamlbuild plugin to build with js_of_ocaml *)

(** {6 Dispatchers} *)

(** The main dispatcher

    The dispatcher should be used with {!Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch} as:
    [Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch Ocamlbuild_js_of_ocaml.dispatcher]
    or if you use oasis it would look like:
    [Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch
       (fun hook ->
         dispatch_default hook;
         Ocamlbuild_js_of_ocaml.dispatcher
           ~oasis_executables:["src/yourprogram.byte"]
           hook;
       )
    ]

    [?oasis_executables] is the paths of the executables
    (having the .byte extension) you want to compile
    as a javascript executable. The former executables are still compiled.

    Side note: {!Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch} should be used only once as
    it record only one function for an ocamlbuild module.
*)
val dispatcher :
  ?oasis_executables:Ocamlbuild_plugin.Pathname.t list ->
  Ocamlbuild_plugin.hook ->
  unit


(** {6 Low level functions} *)

(** Map each targets given as argument to ocamlbuild and replace each element
    that exists in [~executables] by its corresponding .js target.
