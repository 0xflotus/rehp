# Example projects

## Building from source

### Building all example projects

```
$> jbuilder build @DEFAULT
```

This will create a build artifact directory at the root of the this
repository. Each individual project can be found at `./_build/default/examples/`.

### Building an individual project

```
$> cd <path-to-example-project>
$> jbuilder build @DEFAULT
```
