BUGS
====
- check BLEINT, BGTINT, ...
- string access should return an integer!!!

IMPROVEMENTS
============

- We only have to make sure we do not use a
  reserved word not a function used outside for naming variables
  ===> very short variable names
  ===> Bloom filter???

- Compile to CPS + trampoline
  ==> Store exception continuation in a global datastructure
  ==> cheap trampoline: return fun () {...}


- Improved inlining of local functions
  ==> while loops when possible

- Map Caml objects to Javascript objects
- Dynamic loading

DATA REPRESENTATION
===================
- correct implementation of strings
- should probably wrap Ocaml exceptions...

DATA ANALYSIS
=============
- correct analysis (side-effects...)
- faster algorithm
- interprocedural analysis
